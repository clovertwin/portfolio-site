          A few years ago, if someone were to tell me that people would be
          scrolling through a{" "}
          <strong>website that I had built myself from scratch</strong>, I
          wouldn&apos;t <i>hesitate to call them crazy!</i> Not that I
          haven&apos;t been around computers...heck I grew up on the internet ðŸ˜…
          but it all just seemed so <i>mysterious and impossible</i> to ever
          learn.

          If there is <i>one thing I have learned</i> in this life though,
          it&apos;s that most things are not <i>actually impossible</i>,{" "}

          {/* The <i>crazy</i> thing is, this dosen&apos;t really feel like work to

          As I journey further into my understanding of{" "}
          <strong>CSS, Javascript, and React</strong>, and the challenges grow
          steeper, I get more excited to put my skills to use and see what
          I&apos;ve built come to life on the internet.

          I have never gone to college for computer science or ever worked at a
          tech company before, I dont have much to list here for experience.
          What I do have is a{" "}
          <strong>
            burning desire to step up and take my learning to the next level,
            with a company looking for someone who loves a challenge
