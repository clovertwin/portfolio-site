### Where am I? What is this place?

Hello, and welcome to the blog section of my portfolio site! I would like to start things off by
saying thank you for taking the time to come and check out my work. If you have any comments,
suggestions, or find a weird bug please don't hesitate to send me a message using the contact form
on the main page of this site. I'm so excited to now have a place where I can document and share all the things
I'm working on, and maybe someone out there who is learning to code can find something of value here.

### A few of my goals for the upcomming posts

- Explain my journey from knowing nothing about programming to where I am now.
- Show how I built this site, and my reasons for choosing this tech stack.
- Explain how I built this blog so you can make one too.
- Plans for the future.
- Details about how I built select projects.

Another lesser goal I have is to work on my writing in general, and get better with technical writing. So bear with
me as I work on that!

**I hope this all sounds exciting to you, because I can't wait to get started and build this little blog up.**
