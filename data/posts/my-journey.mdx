### My background and why I decided to learn web development

For most of my life I've been one of those people who just can't seem to settle on a direction to take when it comes to careers.
I was average in high school, and when I went to community collage afterwards I felt like I couldn't focus so I dropped out
and got a job working at a grocery store. I figured since it was a stable job and paid the bills, I could focus on making art
which has always been a passion on mine, and maybe someday get somewhere with it.

Then came the pandemic in 2020. This was the single event which woke me up and got me lazer focused on my future. While everyone
else who was skilled got to stay home, I had to go work every day throughout the entire event, feeling more and more like I was
expendable. My journey really begins there, I took out my phone and started searching to see if there were any good careers which
didn't require a collage degree and I started to see "Web Development" popping up again and agian. I didn't own a computer at the
time, but when the government sent out stimulus checks I jumped on the chance to get a laptop and almost immediately I found
[freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### Learning to love learning

Finding freecodecamp was a real eye opener for me. "How cool is it," I thought, "that there is a place for people just starting out to learn the
basics for free, and a whole community of developers rooting you on!" I was instantly in love.
