### My background and why I decided to learn web development

For most of my life I've been one of those people who just can't seem to settle on a direction to take when it comes to careers.
I was average in high school, and when I went to community collage afterwards I felt like I couldn't focus so I dropped out
and got a job working at a grocery store. I figured since it was a stable job and paid the bills, I could focus on making art
which has always been a passion on mine, and maybe someday get somewhere with it.

Then came the pandemic in 2020. This was the single event which woke me up and got me lazer focused on my future. While everyone
else who was skilled got to stay home, I had to go work every day throughout the entire event. Having the ability to work on a computer
where I wasn't surrounded by people became very desirable to me. My journey really began there, I took out my phone and started
searching to see if there were any good careers which didn't require a collage degree and I started to see "Web Development" popping
up again and again. I didn't own a computer at the time, but when the government sent out stimulus checks I jumped on the chance to
get a laptop and almost immediately I found [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### Learning to love learning

Finding freecodecamp was a real eye opener for me. "How cool is it," I thought, "that there is a place for people just starting out to
learn the basics for free, and a whole community of developers rooting you on!" I was instantly in love, though at the same time began
to realize how much I would have to learn, and that this journey was not going to be easy.

As I was going through the basic HTML and CSS sections on f.c.c. I discovered [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/), which offers paid,
but very affordable courses. After reading reviews I decided to try it out and purchased Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp.

I honestly don't think I would have made it as far as I have without this course. Even though it is all online, I really felt like
Angela was there cheering for me, she is one of the best teachers out there and makes even the toughest topics fun and interesting.
At the same time she dosen't sugar coat anything and makes it very clear that things will get hard, and you will want to quit
multiple times along the way, but that if you just keep putting in the work you will reach your goal. That part really stuck with me.

This course was jam packed with information and basically gave me a birds eye view of the whole web development landscape. From front
end to backend, and so much more, it was amazing and I honestly can't praise it enough.

After finishing that, I had a much better idea of what I wanted to do so I purchased a few more courses from Udemy, Colt Steele's
[Modern Javascript bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/),
and Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's [React - The complete guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
Both of which I can highly recommend as well.

### The dreaded tutorial hell

Tutorials are great for basics and general understanding of terminology if you are just starting out, but as soon as you take them away
and have to code something on your own it will become immediately obvious that you never _really_ learned to code by watching them. This
is the part where the challenge really starts I think.

Having no experience with programming or computer science before all this, learning javascript was a steep uphill battle for me. All I
can say is that for me it took a lot of trial, error, practice, and just in general surrounding myself with it to settle the concepts in
my mind.

Another wonderful resource I can recommend at this point is [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/)

Codewars is a huge library of ranked challenges where you are given a set of instructions and are left alone to figure it out. This really
got me spending hours scrolling through the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) learning how to
research and break down problems into managable parts, and really started to make javascript click for me. As an added bonus, after
completing a challenge, you get to see the ways other people figured out the same problem, which never fails to make me feel dumb, but also
holds valuable lessions and makes me want to be smarter with the way I code.

The next and probably best resource for building confidence and breaking free from following tutorials is
[frontendmentor.com](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). There you can sign up for free and select ranked challenges that are front-end focused.
The great thing about this is it has you download a folder that contains all the parts you need like layout designs and images, and even
colors you need to use, but the way the project is built and what technology runs it is left completely up to you. This freed me from having
to spend a ton of time thinking about design (art is hard!) and just focus on building and experimenting with the tech I wanted to.

### End of the first year to now

By this point I had been learning for a year. I know other people have been able to teach themselves to the point of landing a job by now
but also everyone learns at their own speed, my intent was never to rush but to actually **learn** this stuff. If I were to make a list of
each individual technology I had covered it would require it's whole own blog post, but these are a few of the main ones I came out of the
first year focusing on:

- **React**
- **Next.js**
- **Tailwind**
- **Node**
- **SQL/NoSQL databases**

Also **Typescript**, which I am now currently learning. My aim is to convert this site's code base to typescript in the near future. Oh!
Speaking of _this_ site, that is exactly what I decided to start building next in my journey. Because what kind of web developer doesn't
have their own website? It's like a tattoo artist with no tattoos, thats my ðŸ”¥hot takeðŸ”¥. But really, building this site was like a zen
experience for me, and I highly recommend anyone learning to code to make their own too. I'm planning to write my next post about how I
built this site, so I will spare the details for now, but stay tuned if that sounds interesting!

### Final thoughts

I don't want this to come off as self disparaging, but I absolutely am no genious. You however might be, but chances are higher that you
are like me and look at something like teaching yourself to code as too hard, "That's impossible!" you say, "I'm too dumb to ever learn
that," "I have ADHD ðŸ¤ª." Well, I think anyone who sets their mind to it can learn the basics of this stuff. It's like reading a really long
book in a way, it looks huge and daunting at first, but if you just put in 30 minutes a day, which is like a chapter or two, the book is
finite and you _will_ reach the end in a matter of days or weeks, not months like you may assume.

For the sake of brevity I am going to end this post here, but if you are just starting out, I hope this gave you a little overview of places
to look to for learning, and at least a path through the weeds to follow. There is so much I am leaving out, but this journey isn't going to
be the same for everyone anyway. Each person who chooses this path will go their own way, programming is a vast field, and I think there
is something here for anyone who wishes to walk in it.
